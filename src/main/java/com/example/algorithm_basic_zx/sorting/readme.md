1. Selection Sort => done : Not stable
2. Bubble Sort => done: Stable
3. Insertion Sort => done: Stable
4. Merge Sort => done: Stable
5. Quick Sort: Not stable, quickest => done
6. Heap Sort: Not stable, extra space complexity minimum => done
7. Counting sort => done
8. Radix sort => done

1. Big root pile / small root pile => done
2. segment overlap issue => done


- Heap: is Complete Binary Tree

### Sort in engineering
- Primitive type: Quick Sort, no need stable
- Non Primitive type: Merge Sort, need stable
- In quick sort, if array less than 60, use insertion sort
